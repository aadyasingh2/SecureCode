"""
Rule: a variable read on a path where it was never assigned.

This is the rule that needs real data-flow. It reads the definite-assignment
solution, which is path-sensitive, rather than `SymbolTable.is_initialized`,
which is a single flag meaning "assigned somewhere" and reports True for a
variable assigned in only one arm of an if/else.

Out-parameters
--------------
`char buf[64]; gets(buf);` must not be reported: `gets` writes `buf`. Since we
have no interprocedural analysis, any array or pointer passed bare to a call,
and anything passed with `&`, is treated as possibly written by the callee.
